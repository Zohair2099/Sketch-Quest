/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for SketchQuest
 * @version Prototyping Mode - Data shape is not strictly enforced.
 *
 * @Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user-specific data,
 * and allows public read access to shared content like quests. It leverages denormalization
 * to avoid costly `get()` calls and maintains clear segregation of data for secure access control.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 * - `/users/{userId}`: Stores individual user profiles.
 * - `/quests/{questId}`: Stores quest definitions.
 * - `/quests/{questId}/questions/{questionId}`: Stores questions for each quest.
 * - `/users/{userId}/progress/{progressId}`: Stores user progress data.
 * - `/institutions/{institutionId}`: Stores institution information.
 * - `/classes/{classId}`: Stores class information.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is strictly controlled by the owning user.
 * - Quests are publicly readable, but writes are not secured due to the missing ownership field.
 * - Listing of quests and questions is allowed to everyone.
 *
 * @Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - User documents include `institutionId` to avoid `get()` calls when checking institution membership.
